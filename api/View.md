## Methods

### exclude()

Excludes entities with the given components from the view.

- **Type**

    ```lua
    function View:exclude<T...>(components: ...unknown): View<T...>
    ```

- **Details**

    Returns the same view that it was called on.

    Entities with **any** of the excluded components, will not be returned during iteration.

---

### use()

Specifies a component to iterate along.

- **Type**

    ```lua
    function View:use<T...>(component: unknown): View<T...>
    ```

- **Details**

    Returns the same view that it was called on.

    Views, by default, iterate along the smallest pool within the given set of components. This function allows a specific pool to be iterated along instead as long as the component is included in the view.

---

## Iteration

Views support generalized iteration.

```lua
for id: Entity, ...: T... in View<T...> do
```

The entity id followed by the group components are returned.

Components can be added, changed and removed during iteration. Newly added components and their entities will not be returned until the next iteration.

> ⚠️ During iteration, adding or removing components from entities not currently being iterated can invalidate the iterator.

---

## Length

Returns the amount of entities in the view.

```lua
#View<T...>: number
```

For single component views, this returns the exact amount of entities in the view.

For multiple component views, this returns an estimate of the amount of entities.
This estimate will never be greater than the actual amount of entities.
